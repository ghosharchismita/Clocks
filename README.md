# Clocks
This repo consists of two types of clock we see in our daily life namely Analog and Digital clock.
### ANALOG CLOCK :
As we have all seen, an analog clock shows us how the time is changing as the needles of the clock move. I have tried my best to make it aesthetically pleasing and creative by using some SVG and animations in css and also done some work coupled with javascript

Here's a small snapshot of how it looks :

### DIGITAL CLOCK :
This clock shows us the time in digits and indicates whether its AM or PM. Here too I have experimented with SVG animations and some work on CSS and Javascript to make it look creative and out of the box.
This page also shows the day and date.
So summarising this clock gives us an overall idea of the day , date and time.
